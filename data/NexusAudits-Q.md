# QA Report 

## L1: MintProfit Function Has No Events

### Issue 

The `mintProfit` function does not emit any events upon execution. This lack of event logging can hinder tracking and auditing of profit shares minted by credit managers.

### Impact
If a credit manager is compromised, they can mint arbitrary amounts of profit shares without any traceability, posing a security risk.

### Code

```solidity
function mintProfit(uint256 shares, address receiver) public {
    // Logic to mint profit shares
    // Missing event emission
}

```

## L2: Lack of Borrow/Repay Limits

### Issue 

The contract does not impose explicit limits on the amounts that can be borrowed or repaid in a single transaction.
- **Impact**: This could lead to potential manipulation of interest rates or liquidity, as users could exploit the absence of limits to execute large transactions that affect the pool's stability.

### Code

```solidity
function lendCreditAccount(address borrower, uint256 amount) public {
    // Allows unlimited borrowing
}

function repayCreditAccount(address borrower, uint256 amount) public {
    // Allows unlimited repayment
}
```

## L3: lendCreditAccount and repayCreditAccount functions are susceptible to Front-Running Attacks

### Issue

The `lendCreditAccount` and `repayCreditAccount` functions may be vulnerable to front-running attacks, where malicious actors can exploit transaction ordering to gain an advantage.

### Impact

This vulnerability could allow attackers to manipulate the market, affecting the fairness and integrity of the lending process.

### Code

```solidity
function lendCreditAccount(address borrower, uint256 amount) public {
    // Potential for front-running
}

function repayCreditAccount(address borrower, uint256 amount) public {
    // Potential for front-running
}
```

## L4: Lack of Documentation in MintProfit Function

### Issue

The `mintProfit` function lacks comments explaining its purpose or usage, which is inconsistent with the detailed documentation for other functions.

### Impact

This inconsistency can lead to confusion for developers and auditors trying to understand the function's intent and usage.
