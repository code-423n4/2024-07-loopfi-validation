```
if (deltaCollateral < 0) {
            uint256 amount = wmul(abs(deltaCollateral), tokenScale);
            console.log(amount);
            token.safeTransfer(collateralizer, amount);
        }
```

In this code, the safeTransfer function is called to transfer funds to the collateralizer. If the external call is made with the code:

```
vault.modifyCollateralAndDebt({
    owner: position,
    collateralizer: position,
    creditor: address(this),
    deltaCollateral: -1 ether,
    deltaDebt: 0 ether
});
```


it would transfer the contract's tokens to the attacker. However, in the _modifyPosition function, the add operation prevents negative values. This is a potential vulnerability, and this code is unnecessary.
