## Another instance of [NC-24] Incomplete NatSpec: @param is missing on actually documented functions.

This is another instance of the Incomplete NatSpec non-critical QA issue from the automated findings report. 

The calcDecrease() function in CDPVault.sol is missing a @param NatSpec for the uint128 cumulativeQuotaInterest parameter. However, it is not included as an instance in the provided Automated Report :

```
 /// @dev Computes new debt principal and interest index (and other values) after decreasing debt
    ///      - Debt comprises of multiple components which are repaid in the following order:
    ///        quota update fees => quota interest => base interest => debt principal.
    ///        New values for all these components depend on what portion of each was repaid.
    ///      - Debt principal, for example, only decreases if all previous components were fully repaid
    ///      - The new credit account's interest index stays the same if base interest was not repaid at all,
    ///        is set to the current interest index if base interest was repaid fully, and is a solution to
    ///        the equation `debt * (indexNow / indexLastUpdate - 1) - delta = debt * (indexNow / indexNew - 1)`
    ///        when only `delta` of accrued interest was repaid
    /// @param amount Amount of debt to repay
    /// @param debt Debt principal before repayment
    /// @param cumulativeIndexNow The current interest index
    /// @param cumulativeIndexLastUpdate Credit account's interest index as of last update
    /// @return newDebt Debt principal after repayment
    /// @return newCumulativeIndex Credit account's quota interest after repayment
